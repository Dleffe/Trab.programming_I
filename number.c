FOR COURSE: Programming I
DUE DATE: May 29, 2022

PURPOSE:
This programm will calculate the resul of an expression based on
what number the user typed. 

OVERRAL METHOD: 
the list of general tasks is:
1. The user type an entire number.
2. The program performs the expression: 2x+5
3. If the result of it is less than 0, the program performs 
expression:  2*(y*y)-(3*y)+7.
    Else the program performs the task: 4*(y*y)+(5*y)-3.
4. Print the final result in your screen.  

FUNCTIONS:
1. printf : print in the screen. 
2. scanf  : storing data in the memory.
3. if/else: analyzes an condition.

INCLUDE FILES:
    stdio.h
    stdlib.h

DATA FILES:
1. three integers numbers, x; y; z.
